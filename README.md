Yeoman generator for Toba TypeScript modules with standard linting, `tsconfig`, testing, licensing and packaging.

The `package.json` template file must be published with a different name or it affects which files in that folder npm recognizes.

## Usage

### Install Yeoman and the Toba Generator

Yarn
```bash
yarn global add yo
yarn global add generator-toba
```

or npm
```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-toba

```

### Or just upgrade to the latest versions

ls```bash
yarn global upgrade
```

### Then run the generator inside a new module folder

```bash

```
